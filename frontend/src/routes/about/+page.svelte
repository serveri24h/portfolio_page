	<h1>Greetings</h1>
	<p>
		I have created this page as portfolio project and to learn more about frontend development. If your company is looking for a software or data engineer, consider reading more about what skills i can provide and learn if necessary.

	<h3>What am I looking for from an employer?</h3>
	<p>
		I'm mainly looking for an interesting job where I can solve problems. Although that is a very general answer, I get enthusiastic about different things very easily as long as they can provide me with challenges and ways to develop myself further. Therefore, it can be anything from implementing machine learning approaches to systems programming or frontend development. Depending on the assignment, I might require a some learning period. However, I worked for ten for the previous company (during which time the owner and the name changed three times), so I I'm not a guy who jumps between jobs easily and therefore would say the time investement is justified.
