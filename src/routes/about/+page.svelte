	<h1>Greetings</h1>
	<p>
		I have created this page as portfolio project and to learn more about frontend development. If your company is looking for a software or data engineer, consider reading more about what skills i can provide and learn if necessary. 
	</p>

	<h3>Â¨Master of Science and long story short</h3>
	<p>
		I graduated from Aalto University, School of Science in the summer of 2022. I majored in Bioinformatics and digital health. My journey in university started by studying chemical engineering. Although I was interested in the field, I felt like chemistry was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Once I got my bachelor's degree, I decided to apply for a master's programme in bioinformatics. When I first started studying bioinformatics, I was overwhelmed by the computer science part of the programme. I had to study extra to understand the prerequisites, but once I got there I fell in love with computing, machine learning, and programming in general. I was particularly interested in deep learning and wrote neural network algorithms from scracths several times just understand the algorithm as compehensively as possible and finally wrote my master's about deep learning methodologies in drug kinase prediction.

	<h3>Skills, traits and what I'm doing now</h3>
	<p>
		I would consider myself a generalist instead of a specialist. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of my studies, I understand mathematics, computer science, machine learning, statistics, chemistry, and biology. Although I'm not an expert in any of the mentioned fields, I'm an active learner who develops his skills every day. After graduation, I've been adopting new programing languages and improving my knowledge in web development, networking and systems programming.
	</p>

	<h3>What am I looking for from an employer?</h3>
	<p>
		I'm mainly looking for an interesting job where I can solve problems. Although that is a very general answer, I get enthusiastic about different things very easily as long as they can provide me with challenges and ways to develop myself further. Therefore, it can be anything between implementing machine learning approaches or frontend development.
