	<h1>Greetings</h1>
	<p>
		I have created this page as portfolio project and to learn more about frontend development. If your company is looking for a software or data engineer, consider reading more about what skills i can provide and learn if necessary. 
	</p>

	<h3>Education: Master of Science</h3>
	<p>
		I graduated from Aalto University, School of Science in summer 2022. I majored in Bioinformatics and digital health and wrote my master's about deep learning methodologies in drug kinase prediction. My journey in university started by studying chemical engineering and I was particularly curious about organic chemistry. However, once I finnished my bachelor's thesis I felt like chemistry was not what I wanted to do rest of my life. I decided to applied for masters programme in bioinformatics.

	<h3>Skills and traits</h3>
	<p>
		I would consider myself as a generalist instead of a specialist. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of my studies, I understand mathematics, computer science, machine learning, statistics, chemistry and biology. After graduation, I've been strengthening my developper skills and improving my knowledge in.  
	</p>

	<h3>What am I looking from employer</h3>
	<p>
		I'm mainly looking for interesting job where I can solve problems. Although that is very general answer, I'm also certainly more of a generalist than specialist. I get enthusiastic about different things very easily as long as they can provide ways to develop myself further. Therefore, it does not matter too much whether it's by implementing machine learning approaches or by hard coding. After my graduation, I wanted to get some distance from ML and therefore taught myself basic webdevelopment skills, systems programming with rust and c and polished some other skills.
